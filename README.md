# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms Final Project 📚

This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the Data Structures and Algorithms final project. Follow these steps carefully to ensure the application runs smoothly.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- ☕ Java (JDK 11 or later)
- 🟩 Node.js and npm

## Installation 📦

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

### Step 1: Download the Data File 📄

Download the `places.txt` file. This file contains the data needed for the application to run.

### Step 2: Prepare Data Folder 📂

Copy the `places.txt` file into the `data` folder in your project directory.

## Backend Setup 🌐

### Step 3: Run the SpringBoot Backend

1. Navigate to the `src/main/java/com/example/testapi` directory.
2. Find the `APIApplication.java` class and run it. This action starts the SpringBoot backend.

## Frontend Setup 🖥️

### Step 4: Set Up the Frontend Environment

1. Open the terminal.
2. Change directory to the frontend source folder:
   ```bash
   cd fe/src
   ```
   Alternatively, right-click on the folder and select "Open in Integrated Terminal".

### Step 5: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all the necessary modules:
```bash
npm i
```
Wait for the installation to complete before moving to the next step.

### Step 6: Start the React Application 🚀

Execute the following command to start the React app:

### Step 7: Application Loading ⏳

Please be patient as the React application might take some time to load.

### Step 8: Verify Startup 🖥️

Once the application starts up in your browser, the setup is complete.

## Usage 🎯

Now that the application is running, you can start using it. Enjoy exploring the functionalities integrated into our Data Structures and Algorithms project.
