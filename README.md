# Data Structures and Algorithms Final Project

This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the Data Structures and Algorithms final project. Follow these steps carefully to ensure the application runs smoothly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Java (JDK 11 or later)
- Node.js and npm

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

### Step 1: Download the Data File

Download the `places.txt` file. This file contains the data needed for the application to run.

### Step 2: Prepare Data Folder

Copy the `places.txt` file into the `data` folder in your project directory.

## Backend Setup

### Step 3: Run the SpringBoot Backend

1. Navigate to the `src/main/java/com/example/testapi` directory.
2. Find the `APIApplication.java` class and run it. This action starts the SpringBoot backend.

## Frontend Setup

### Step 4: Set Up the Frontend Environment

1. Open the terminal.
2. Change directory to the frontend source folder:
   ```bash
   cd fe/src
   ```
   Alternatively, right-click on the folder and select "Open in Integrated Terminal".

### Step 5: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all the necessary modules:
```bash
npm i
```
Wait for the installation to complete before moving to the next step.

### Step 6: Start the React Application

Execute the following command to start the React app:
```bash
npm start
```

### Step 7: Application Loading

Please be patient as the React application might take some time to load.

### Step 8: Verify Startup

Once the application starts up in your browser, the setup is complete.

## Usage

Now that the application is running, you can start using it. Enjoy exploring the functionalities integrated into our Data Structures and Algorithms project.
